        <h3>Some explanation</h3>
        <p>tr means table row.</p>
        <p>td means table data</p>
        <p>th means table head</p>
        <p>HTML5 encourages semantic markups. So, by using thead and tbody, the appearance doesnt change. But it helps other applications read the code (think of SEO, web spyders.)</p>
        <p>
            Typically, a table attribute doesn't have any border. You use CSS to create that border.
            However, for now, just use border=1. Note: This is HTML4 and deprecated
