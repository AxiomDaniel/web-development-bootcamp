        <h4>My hobbies:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Algorithmic problem solving</li>
            <li>Coding python</li>
            <li>Coding the holy trinity of front-end</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Some note about CSS: Inline styling is deprecated. Using a style tag on the head of the html file is not good as well. But still lesser evil of the two.</h4>
        <p>It's easy to see why. If you want a whole list of similar elements to be the same colour, you gotta copy paste a ton of code.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, just giving it an identifier and then writing the styling in another file is gonna save a lot of lines of code.</p>
        <p>Also, as Dijkstra mentioned, 'separation of concerns' Styles and text should be two separate entities</p>

        <h3>On an unrelated note, the head section of the html file is for whatever that is not directly shown on the page.</h3>
        <p>For example, font, colour, CSS stuff, Javascript as well.</p>
        <h4>On another unrelated note, you should really start spelling "colour" in freedom language. Coz you know... CSS doesn't understand proper english.</h4>

        <h4>To find a colour for your page, just use a colour picker. GGRKS</h4>
        <h4>If you want to have transparent font, use rgba in CSS, a stands for alpha and goes from 0 to 1</h4>
